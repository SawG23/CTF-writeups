# 🧠 CTF Writeups by SawG

Welcome to my **CTF Writeups** repository!

This is where I share my personal writeups and solutions from Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions I've participated in. These writeups cover a variety of challenges across different categories such as:

- 🐚 Reverse Engineering  
- 🔎 Forensics  
- 🧩 Miscellaneous

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Document my learning process and problem-solving approaches
- Share knowledge and techniques with the security community
- Help others learn from both successful and failed attempts

Feel free to explore, learn, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
